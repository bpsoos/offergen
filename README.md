# offergen
offergen - Inventory management and public catalog generator. Organize inventory, track details, and create shareable public listings of your offerings.

This is a work in progress, currently in early development phase. The idea is to create a HTMX and Go based, fully open source platfrom where users can sign up for free, manage their inventory and host a publicly available catalog based on it.
